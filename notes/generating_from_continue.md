Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space

`vae`

## 2 Background

#### 2.1 Unsupervised sentence encoding

standard RNN language model: not learn a vector representation of the full sentence

sequence autoencoders

- an encoder function: $\varphi _{enc}$

- a probabilistic decoder model $p(x|\hat z = \varphi _{enc})$

standard autoencoders are note effective at extracting for global semantic features

#### 2.2 The variational autoencoder
